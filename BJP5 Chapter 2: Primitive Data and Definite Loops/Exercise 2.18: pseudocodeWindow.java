/* Write a pseudocode algorithm that will produce the following figure as output: 

+===+===+
|   |   |
|   |   |
|   |   |
+===+===+
|   |   |
|   |   |
|   |   |
+===+===+

(Since this is just pseudo-code, Practice-It is not able to verify that your solution is "correct". 
But you can submit an answer anyway to show that you completed this exercise. Any non-trivial answer will be accepted.)

As said above you could pretty much write anything as long as your write enough lines of text you'll pass.

Create a method called frame
 in this method print(+===+===+)

Create a method called window
 in this method print(|   |   |) three times

call methods in the order of

frame
window
frame
window
frame
